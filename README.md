# This is coffee-button !

This repo holds the code to the awesome coffee button app we will use to streamline coffee stock renewal in Zenika Nantes.
This is mainly `bash` code, that we will send to a Raspberry Pi and that will be launched on startup, to call a Zappier URL sending an email to our coffe provider and a message on Slack.

Feel free to contribute!

## Things to do:

 - [X] write the script
 - [X] create the Zappier endpoint
 - [X] try it!
 - [ ] add leds?
 - [ ] add Slack notifications
